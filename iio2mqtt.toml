# Examples for specific sensor types:

# For accelerometer (3-axis):
# channels = ["in_accel_x", "in_accel_y", "in_accel_z"]

# For gyroscope (3-axis):
# channels = ["in_anglvel_x", "in_anglvel_y", "in_anglvel_z"]

# For magnetometer (3-axis):
# channels = ["in_magn_x", "in_magn_y", "in_magn_z"]

# For temperature sensor:
# channels = ["in_temp"]

# For pressure sensor:
# channels = ["in_pressure"]

# For light/proximity sensor:
# channels = ["in_illuminance", "in_proximity"]

# Mixed sensors (reading multiple types):
# channels = ["in_accel_x", "in_accel_y", "in_accel_z", "in_temp"]
